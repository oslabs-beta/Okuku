<h2>Design and scale a real-time streaming data pipeline at the click of a button.</h2>

[EvaStudio.dev](http://www.evastudio.dev/)

<p align="left"> <b> evaStudio (beta) </b> is a web GUI and testing playground for quickly designing and scaling your event-driven data architecture with Kafka brokers and Zookeeper, sourcing streaming data from a CSV, SQL database, or HTTP/API, to Apache Spark or Jupyter Notebook for analysis. Designed with data scientists in mind, EvaStudio makes it easy to develop, orchestrate, experiment, and monitor machine learning workflows at scale, so you can focus on analytical challenges instead of infrastructure.</p>
